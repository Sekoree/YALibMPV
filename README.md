# YALibMPV
Yet Another LibMPV Wrapper/PInvoke library

All methods, structs, enums and callbacks from client.h, render.h, render_gl.h and stream_cb.h should be there (I think)

I'm too lazy to test everything, I just need this for another project, if you feel like something could be better, yell at me in an issue or do a pull request.

This is partially inspired by [NickVision.MPVSharp](https://github.com/NickvisionApps/MPVSharp) and [LibMPV](https://github.com/homov/LibMpv)

Any similarities are purely coincidental (cause same headers ofc)

## Current state of this

- Linux is very untested
- OSX too (I dont have hardware for that, but I wanted to include it)
- The most tested stuff is the Node stuff
- The render methods are also untested as I just used the "wid" command/Native embedding so far in my other project
