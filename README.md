# YALibMPV
Yet Another LibMPV Wrapper/PInvoke library

All methods, structs, enums and callbacks from client.h, render.h, render_gl.h and stream_cb.h mapped (I think)

I'm too lazy to test everything, I just need this for another project, if you feel like something could be better, feel free to yell at me in issues or do a pull request.

Currently it just supports the Windows version of libmpv, but that should be easy to change.

This is partially inspired by [NickVision.MPVSharp](https://github.com/NickvisionApps/MPVSharp) and [LibMPV](https://github.com/homov/LibMpv) 

Any similarities are purely cause, well, we all map the same library.
